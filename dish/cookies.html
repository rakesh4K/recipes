    <p>These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a ganache filling
        that bumps up the rich chocolate flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie</p>
    <p>Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet
        chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla.
        Variations on the recipe may add other types of chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or
        oatmeal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>powedered sugar</li>
        <li>large egg</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>cocoa powder</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>sanding sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven.
            Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg
            and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. With mixer on low
            speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. Place on the prepared baking
            sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep
            and 1/2-inch wide).</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating top to bottom
            and bottom to top halfway through, until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of each ball with your
            thumb againâ€”the indentations will have puffed in the oven.</li>
        <li>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. Remove from
            the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until
            melted and smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 teaspoon
            filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes
            to set the filling. The cookies will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room
            temperature.</li>
    </ol>
